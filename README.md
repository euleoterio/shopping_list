# Product List

This is a Product List project, where you can manage a list of products by adding, editing, and deleting items. The project is divided into a backend developed in Java with Spring Boot and a frontend developed in JavaScript.

## Backend

The backend is built with Java using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the products. The API is responsible for handling product data, including adding new products, editing existing information, and deleting products from the list.

### Technologies Used in the Backend

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Lombok
- H2 Database

The backend project uses Maven as the project's dependency and build manager. Lombok is used to reduce Java code verbosity, while H2 Database is used as an in-memory database to store product data.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed in JavaScript and interacts with the backend through the RESTful API provided by Spring Boot. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface for managing the product list. Users can view all products, add new products, edit existing product information, and delete products from the list.

## Features

- Add a new product
- View the list of products
- Edit information of an existing product
- Delete a product from the list


This project was created as a demonstration of basic CRUD using Java Spring Boot and JavaScript. Feel free to explore and contribute to the development of this project!
